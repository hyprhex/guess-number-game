## Guess the Number Game

**Description:** Guess the Number Game is a simple text-based game where the computer generates a random number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the number. The game provides feedback to the player, letting them know if their guess is too high or too low, helping them to narrow down their guesses until they guess the correct number.

**How the Game Works:**

1. **Generate Random Number:** The computer generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., between 1 and 100).

2. **Get User Input:** The game prompts the player to enter their guess for the number.

3. **Check Guess:** The game compares the player's guess with the randomly generated number.

4. **Provide Feedback:** Based on the comparison, the game provides feedback to the player:
   - If the guess is correct, the player wins the game.
   - If the guess is higher than the random number, the game tells the player that their guess is too high and prompts them to try again.
   - If the guess is lower than the random number, the game tells the player that their guess is too low and prompts them to try again.

5. **Repeat or End:** The game repeats steps 2 to 4 until the player guesses the correct number or decides to quit the game.

6. **Option to Quit:** The player may have the option to quit the game at any time by entering a special command or a specific number.

**Potential Improvements:**

- **Limited Attempts:** Set a maximum number of attempts for the player to guess the number, making the game more challenging.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Implement different difficulty levels, where the range of possible numbers changes based on the chosen level (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the number of attempts it took the player to guess the correct number and display it at the end of the game.
- **User Interface Enhancement:** Instead of a simple text-based interface, you can create a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Learning Goals:**

- **Random Number Generation:** Practice generating random numbers within a given range.
- **Conditional Statements:** Use conditional statements to provide feedback to the player based on their guess.
- **User Input and Validation:** Handle user input and validate it to ensure it's within the acceptable range.
- **Loops:** Use loops to allow the player to continue playing until they guess the correct number or choose to quit.
